# Why
I wanted to learn a modern game engine, Godot was recommended to me :-)


# What
RoddRunner is a clone of [Lode Runner](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lode_Runner) a 8bit game edited in 1983 a nice online version is available [here](https://loderunnerwebgame.com/game/). I enhanced the graphics a bit, gameplay should be close to the original


# Contrib
I used the Lazenby Comuter font by Andrew Young, available at http://disasterfonts.co.uk/
To produce the characters, I used Body Mechanics Rigs by [vinchau](https://blendswap.com/profile/321006) available [here](https://blendswap.com/blend/19110=
